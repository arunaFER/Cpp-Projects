Operator Overloading (Member Functions)

Created MyString class with attribute char* str;
Use of c style strings.

- unary minus. Returns the lowercase version of the object's string
           -s1
==    - returns true if the two strings are equal
           (s1 == s2)
!=     - returns true if the two strings are not equal 
           (s1 != s2)
<      - returns true if the lhs string is lexically less than the rhs string
           (s1 < s2)
>      - returns true if the lhs string is lexically greater than the rhs string
          (s1 > s2)
+      - concatenation. Returns an object that concatenates the lhs and rhs
           s1 + s2
+=     - concatenate the rhs string to the lhs string and store the result in lhs object
          s1 += s2;      equivalent to s1 = s1 + s2;
*      - repeat -  results in a string that is copied n times
          s2 * 3;          ex). s2 = "abc"; 
                                s1 = s2 * 3;
                                s1 will result in "abcabcabc"
*=      - repeat the string on the lhs n times and store the result back in the lhs object
            s1 = "abc";
            s1 *= 4;        s1 = s1 will result in "abcabcabcabc"
